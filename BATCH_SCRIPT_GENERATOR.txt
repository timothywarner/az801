Due to the large number of remaining scripts (21), I will now create all of them 
systematically with production-quality PowerShell code for AZ-801 certification training.

Each script will include:
✓ Real PowerShell cmdlets and tools
✓ Troubleshooting workflows  
✓ Best practices
✓ Production-ready demonstrations

Creating scripts for:
- Module 23 (3 remaining): VM Insights, Arc Extensions, Update Manager
- Module 24 (6 scripts): All troubleshooting core services
- Module 25 (5 scripts): All advanced troubleshooting
- Module 26 (7 scripts): All AD troubleshooting

Let's proceed...
